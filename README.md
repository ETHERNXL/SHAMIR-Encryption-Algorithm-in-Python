# SHAMIR-Encryption-Algorithm-in-Python
School project. SHAMIR-Encryption-Algorithm-in-Python.
As a result of the work, a program was obtained in which software encryption was implemented according to Shamir.
The three-step Shamir protocol is a cryptographic three-step protocol developed by Adi Shamir around 1980. 
The protocol allows two parties to exchange messages securely without the need to share encryption keys.
Message exchange between users takes place in three passes.
